There are a lot of mixed attitudes towards so called 'self help books', books that aim to take aspects of psychology and its theories and use them to advise and encourage people to look within themselves and find ways to enhance their strengths and understand themselves better to better their mental and physical quality of life. While popularly sold in western countries, some feel that they promise a pipe dream and are less effective than they claim to be in improving people's lives.
